# Vim Mermaid runtime files

This is the upstream version of Vim's included syntax highlighting rules and filetype settings for [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/).

## How to install this package

> [!NOTE]
> You generally don't _need_ to install these files, as they are occasionally merged by Vim downstream.  

### Vim 8+ with native :packadd command

From Vim 8.0 onward, users can follow the setup instructions in `:help packages`. 

### Other package managers

What about pathogen, vim-plug, plug.nvim, lazy.nvim, bundle, minipac, ... ?

Please refer to the documentation of that specific package manager.
