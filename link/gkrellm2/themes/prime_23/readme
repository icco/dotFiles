GKrellm theme: Prime

This is my first theme I created for GKrellm. I did not like all these
3D themes which exist, so I did my own one. Just oldskool 2D graphics
with nice colors. For all of those who like the colors, checkout the matching 
FLuxbox theme (available at themes.freshmeat.net) I made.

Enjoy it.

ps: A cool wallpaper which uses nearly the same color range is available on
