Copland OS Lain Theme 
---------------------

This is my first attempt at creating an original theme, but I must
confess that many parts of it are based on existing themes.
Still, I haven't left any image untouched (not really), so maybe I can
considered it as fully original.  Even this README me is
unoriginal!!!!!!!!! But who cares, right? :)

This theme is loosly based on the OS software used in the Japanese
anime, Serial Experiments Lain -- most noticably, the Copland OS logo.
This theme also goes nicelty with the Sepiroth theme for fluxbox, for
which I originally designed this to match loosely, as well.

Hope you like the rotating Copland OS logo for the e-mail.  I originaly
made the animation in Bryce (3d rendering progrom) to replace the IE
Logo for Microsoft Windows (akk, i know!)  anyways, I hope you like it.
I wish the animation could be displayed faster somehow -- too many
frames, i guess.  would look real sweet if it was speeded up.

plans for upgrade?  maybe. different gkrellmms icons would be nice.
although the current ones suit the theme well, I think.  A different
timer button, and modem lights would be cool, too.  Not sure what to do,
though.  

any comments, ideas, suggustions, additions, please email me.
