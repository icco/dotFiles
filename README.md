# Nat Welch's .Files

This repository holds my config files for just about everything. Use this to set up a fresh OSX or Linux box, and Nat will be a happy user.

## Install

Originally I did this entirely with shell scripts. Now I use rake. Make sure to `gem install rake` and install ruby 1.9.2 before going ahead with `rake infect`

## Notes

Apparently other people have made similar things to my infect script.

 * [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)
 * [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

In the future, it'd be really cool to set up GitHub with my public key, all through a script. Having to set up permissions before I infect is a pita.
