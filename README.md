# Nat Welch's .Files

This repository holds my config files for just about everything. Use this to set up a fresh OSX or Linux box, and Nat will be a happy user.

## Install

 * `git clone git@github.com:icco/dotFiles.git`
 * `./infect.sh`

## Notes

Apparently other people have made similar things to my infect script.

 * [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)

In the future, it'd be really cool to set up github with my public key, all through a script. Having to set up permissions before I infect is a pita.
